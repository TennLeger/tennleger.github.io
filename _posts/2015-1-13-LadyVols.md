# Lady Vols

Today at the Eyes on Tennessee [rally for women](http://healthyandfreetn.org/news/statewide-march-on-nashville-and-eyesontn-roundtable), a speaker protested the University of Tennessee - Knoxville [forbidding the use of "Lady Vols"](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/17/tennessee-athletics-drop-lady-womens-programs) and the accompanying logo to describe sports teams besides the women basketball players. The Lady Vols have a proud history of struggle for the rights of women players, and rightfully celebrate Pat Summit's accomplishments in collegiate sports. The Lady Vols are seen by many as a symbol of that struggle for women's equality, and there are strong feelings in support of its continuation. However, the University is enacting a rebranding wherein all other teams, both male and female, will use a "Power T" logo and simply be called [Volunteers](http://www.utsports.com/fans/traditions.html). Some other feminists [celebrate this change](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2014/11/12/christine-brennan-tennessee-volunteers-or-lady-volunteers/18939961/) as a more equitable arrangement for women's sports teams at the University.
